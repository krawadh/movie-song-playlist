# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

This is the boiler plate screen where you have to code for add movie, song by clicking the "Add Movie to Playlist" and "Add Song to Playlist" button respectively.
And another feature on top left corner which will have reset the both playlist by clicking the "Rest Both Playlists" button.

Second screen look like given below after adding Movies and Songs in there playlists.

Here need to implement remove Movie and Song by clicking the cross button.
Also need to implement reset the both playlist that means remove the all Movies and Songs at time.


If any issue let me know ASAP!
